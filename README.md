**NEW SDK BOARD** - Availability planned for March 2026.

## History

The Compact Weather IoT Monitor boards such as the [CWX](https://github.com/DitroniX/CWX-Compact-Weather-Station) series, and [AQIX](https://github.com/DitroniX/AQIX-Air-Quality-Monitor-IoT-Weather-Station), have been popular, especially for education purposes  and home use.

Taking the CWX and AQIX concept, a new LoRa enabled version has been designed.  This is called AQIL.

High Precision Digital Environmental Monitor Sensors.  

The **AQIL** board offers the following main features:

 - **Espressif ESP32-C6**
	 - WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee and Thread
 - **EByte E22-900MM22S**
	 - LoRa (LoRaWAN), SX1262 module for 850 MHz through to 930 MHz
 - **Sensirion SCD40 or SCD41**
	 - High Accuracy CO2 Sensor
 - **Bosch BME280**
	 - High Precision Barometric Pressure, Relative Humidity and Temperature
 - **EEPROM P24C64C**
	 - 64Kbit storage (logging and/or parameters)
-   **USB C**
	 - With UART for easy programming and development
	 - Board powering during development or use.
-   **I2C Interface Display**
	 - OLED Display
-   **I2C Interface Sensors**
	 - External Sensors such as Soil Monitoring
-   **3V3 LDO**
	 - External 4.5 to 15V DC Input
-   **LED**
	 - RGB, Ext DC LED
-   **Board Size**
	 - 63 x 51mm

Power can be via external 5 to 15V DC, or using a CR123A 3V Lithium battery. CR123A Battery is not a rechargeable.

This board could also be powered from a Solar Panel.
